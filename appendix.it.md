RMS è noto per maltrattare le donne e farle sentire a disagio, insicure e non benvenute. Per gli incidenti relativi a RMS e al MIT, vedi [0].

Le opinioni di RMS sulle leggi che puniscono lo stupro e il sesso con minori sono state pubblicamente discusse nell'autunno 2019, quando Selam G scrisse a proposito.[1] Sono agghiacciante in particolare i commenti di Stallman riguardo le accuse fatte a Marvin Minsky di aver stuprato Virginia Giuffre, una delle vittime dei traffici di esseri umani di Jeffrey Epstein, affermando che «lo scenario più plausibile è che lei si fosse concessa a lui in modo del tutto volontario».[2] RMS ha inoltre commentato che non fosse una «violenza sessuale» perché «"violentare" presume che lui abbia fatto ricorso alla forza o alla violenza», mentre il resoconto in oggetto «non dice niente del genere. Solo che hanno fatto sesso».[3]

Rather than discussing this further, let’s instead focus on his personal web site, where he also shares his views on minors being "entirely willing."[4] (Note: While several news reports misrepresented Stallman's position while discussing allegations against Minsky, Stallman has previously expressed opinions that were consistent with the inaccurate portrayal.)

He regularly and repeatedly makes comments about “the dishonest law that labels sex with adolescents as 'rape' even if they are willing."[5] He compares United States law to Sudanese law in saying that “US laws that define 'rape' to include voluntary sex with under N years of age (where N varies)” and that “both laws falsify the meaning of ‘rape.’”[6]

Riguardo il caso in cui una donna abbia fatto sesso con un minore, ha detto «Vorrei che una donna attraente avesse "abusato" di me in quel modo quando avevo 14 anni».[7] He directly addressed child pornography by saying that “making such photos should be a crime, and is a crime, but that is no reason to prohibit possessing copies of the photos.”[8] He defended pedophilia, in general, in saying that “there is little evidence to justify the widespread assumption that willing participation in pedophilia hurts children.”[9] (Note: RMS apologized for this comment on 14 September, 2019.[Citation][10].

In 2015 and 2016 RMS made three posts on his website about Down’s syndrome. He recommended that, should someone find out they are pregnant and the child tests positive for Down’s syndrome “the right course of action for the woman is to terminate the pregnancy.”[11] He referred to people deciding to “carry fetuses with Down’s syndrome to term” as “perverse” and said that there is “nothing virtuous” in “[increasing] the number of people that have Down’s syndrome.”[12] He also said that “when a fetus has Down's syndrome, you should abort it and try again.”[13] On at least one occasion RMS likened having a child with Down’s syndrome to having a pet.[14] (Note: Link 14 added 25 March, 2021 - 11:33 EDT.)

RMS has spent years on a campaign against using people’s correct pronouns. This is poorly disguised transphobia. In the original publication of the GNU Kind Communication Guidelines, he said “there are various ways to express gender neutrality in third-person singular pronouns in English; you do not have to use 'they.'”[15] This text has since been updated, but is still transphobic.[16] The main page on his web site includes the statement that  “‘They’ is plural — for singular antecedents, use singular gender-neutral pronouns.”[17]
